## PROJECT NOTES
###### v2
I wasn't happy with the site load times, the jQuery and Bootstrap just added too much bloat to the site, especially since I was only using Bootstrap for the grid. I removed the frameworks and instead just used flexbox with some media queries for heights. 
The page was also too static, so I added some pure css card flip animations. I also finally got around to fixing the the sticky :hover issue with a simple js if-check.
Overall, I was able to keep the look of the site while making it much lighter and faster. 

###### v1
This site turned out pretty well. Learning Bootstrap was a good way to see that sometimes, you just don't need a framework.
With all the media queries I had to put in for heights, the grid layout didn't save all that much time with coding. I will
likely comeback at a later point and only use the parts of the framework that I need.
As this is a portfolio site, it isn't finished yet, but it's fully functional. I still need to add some jQuery for bonus features, 
and I want to add a carousel at some point to showcase some of my graphic design work. But for now, I like how the whole thing looks.
